#Hello world, --4/13/2021

From trying to understand every little thing about computers in a measly handful
of years I have gotten hardly anywhere.

Summarizing my knowledge seems to be pointless so I should probably code some things to prove my knowledge. But what to make that is worth while...
I could make a resemblence of a website. But the contents would be lacking... Same goes for a game. At this point content and purpose have flown away. I am mainly typing here to just get used to using Github because I belive it will help with my organization. If you are reading this it seems that I may have made some leaps and bounds towards creating something.

Sincerly,
Trey and his headphones
